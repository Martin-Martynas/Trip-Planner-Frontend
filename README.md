# React + Vite
We'll be using Vite. You'll need Node.js installed for the npm command line tool.
Open up your terminal and bootstrap a new React app with Vite:
npm create vite@latest name-of-your-project -- --template react
# follow prompts
cd <your new project directory>
npm install react-router-dom localforage match-sorter sort-by react-datepicker query-string
Additionally:
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
Then to launch the app:
npm run dev

You should be able to visit the URL printed in the terminal:
VITE v3.0.7  ready in 175 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
